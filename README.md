Hiraeth is the product of 10+ years of PHP framework development. Over those 10+ years, the PHP ecosystem has grown and developed to include some truly great libraries and components. At the beginning of that journey, developers who were concerned with ease of use, stability, or flexibility encountered many barriers in the course of application or website development.

These barriers no longer exist. Hiraeth is designed to let you use and re-use the packages you love without locking you in.

> Hiraeth (pronounced [hiraɪ̯θ]) is a Welsh word for which there is no direct English translation. The online Welsh-English dictionary of the University of Wales, Lampeter likens it to homesickness tinged with grief or sadness over the lost or departed. -- Wikipedia

## What is a Nano-Framework?

The term "nano-framework" was chosen for Hiraeth due to the extremely limited scope of its core components.  At its core, Hiraeth is only concerned with three distinct responsibilities:

1. Basic Application Services
2. Dependency Injection
3. Configuration

All functionality beyond these is provided by separate packages which bridge third-party solutions with the Hiraeth architecture.
